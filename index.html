			<p class="intro">Starting a business is hard, but that means some neighborhoods continue to go without reliable access to food. When supermarkets are the primary source of food in many neighborhoods, getting one to open in areas with limited access can be difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
				Physical food access is the first step in food security. For people in a neighborhood to eat well, they need access to better food, such as fresh produce and raw materials.
				</p>
				<p>
				While many areas in major cities have bodegas or small corner grocers, an important source of food for many, these stores typically do not stock ingredients for healthier cooking or large selections of fresh foods.
				</p>
				<p>
				Even more important, though, is having multiple grocers in a neighborhood.
				</p>
				<p>
				“An outcome could be increased competition” when there are multiple grocers opening in an area, said Nevin Cohen, director of the CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute. But he also notes that more grocery stores do not on their own increase the health of a neighborhood. It takes affordability and education as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				If a supermarket opening in a neighborhood is the first step in making neighborhoods more healthy, what are the ways that can happen here in New York City?
